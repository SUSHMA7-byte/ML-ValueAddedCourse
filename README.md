# VALUE ADDED COURSES PROJECTS

Welcome to the repository for our value-added course projects! Within this repository, you'll find two Jupyter notebooks showcasing our work on predictive analytics and marketing strategies. The first notebook, titled 'Diabetes Prediction', dives into the realm of healthcare analytics, where we explore various machine learning algorithms to predict the onset of diabetes based on patient data. In this notebook, we analyze datasets, preprocess the data, and implement predictive models to aid in early detection and management of diabetes.

The second notebook, 'Direct Marketing Campaigns (Random Forest)', delves into the domain of marketing analytics. Here, we investigate the effectiveness of different marketing strategies, particularly focusing on direct marketing campaigns. Leveraging the power of Random Forest algorithms, we analyze customer data, identify key features influencing campaign success, and provide insights to optimize future marketing efforts. Each notebook offers comprehensive documentation, code implementation, and analysis, providing valuable resources for both learning and practical application.
